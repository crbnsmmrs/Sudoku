#### Disclaimer
A Sudoku game made for a group project in school. I created a new repository to house only my portion of the program as to not steal code from others and to challenge myself to do every portion. If I left any of their code I could easily be tempted into “copying” what they did. My task was to make just the GUI with no game logic based of the functions that they wanted to add.
